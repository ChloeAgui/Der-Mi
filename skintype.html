    <h2>Understanding what your skin needs</h2>
    <h3> Skin Cravings...not Skin Types!</h3>
</div>

<div>   <!--Intro-->
    <p>
    <b>
    We often attempt to understand how to treat our skin by confining our skin into rigid categories: 
    <br>
    dry, oily, combination, sensitive and acne prone. 
    <br>
    <br>
     If only it were that easy…
    <br>
    <br>
    But alas, our skin is much more complicated than that! The state of our skin can change and experience multiple 
    <br>
    labels of skin types which are meant to be definitive from one another. For some people, they may have dry, oily, <br>
    and acne-prone skin! This is why trying to simply select one skin type label just doesn't always work.
    <br>
    Genetics aren’t solely responsible for the conditions of our skin, environmental factors are too! Your 
    <br>
    environment, changes in weather, diet, hormone levels, and so many more external factors play into all 
    <br>
    different types of skin troubles! So instead of curating a skin care routine centred around what type you think <br>
    your skin comes under..
    <br>
    <br>
    Observe, feel, and listen to what your skin needs in this moment.

    <h3>If your skin is feeling….</h3> 
    <h3>•	Dry </h3>
    <h4>First identify whether your skin is dry or dehydrated? Or both? </h4>
    <p> 
    <b>
    If you have dry skin, you may be experiencing: 
    </b>
    <br>
    o	Rough uneven skin texture 
    <br>
    o	Cracking 
    <br>
    o	Peeling 
    <br>
    o	Flaking 
    <br>
    o	Irritation/Sensitive
    <br>
    o	Lack of hydration
    <br> 
    o	Pronounced lines/wrinkles
    </p>
    <h4>
    <b>
    If your skin is dehydrated, you may be experiencing:
    </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
    o	Tightness 
    <br>
    o	Skin surface cell deflation  
    <br>
    o	Creases, fine lines 
    <br>
    o	Dryness
    <br>
    o	Oiliness 
    <br>
    o	Foundation becoming patchy 
    <br>
    <br>
    (Secret tip: To test whether your skin is hydrated, pinch the skin 
    <br>
    on the back of your hand. If the skin is slow to sink back down, your skin is dehydrated.)
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<div>  <!--DRY SKIN-->
    <h3>Dry Skin</h3>   
    <p>
    Experiencing dry skin means that your sebacceous glands are not producing enough sebum. 
    <br>
     As a result, your skin lacks the natural barrier (sebum oil) that keeps it moisturised and balanced. 
    <br>   
    <br>
    <p>
    <b>The possible causes of dry skin are: </b>
    <br>
    o	Genetics 
    <br>
    o	Over cleansing 
    <br>
    o	Over exfoliating 
    <br>
    o	Hot showers 
    <br>
    o	Indoor heating 
    <br>
    o	Cold, windy weather 
    <br>
    o	Cleansing tools (e.g. pore brushes) 
    <br>
    o	And more!
    </p>
    <h3>What should I do?</h3>
    <h4><b>1. Cleanse. As. Little. As. Possible.
    <br>
    <br>
    And GENTLY</b>
    </h4>
    <p>
    Cleansers contain surfactants, which are the cleansing ingredients in your cleansing product; they bind into 
    <br>
    the oil of our skin and dissolve into the water that we use to wash off our faces resulting in a clean face!
    <br>
    But cleansing for too long, too harshly, or too many times can risk our cleanser dissolving our natural lipid 
    <br>
    barrier which is essential for keeping the moisture and hydration balanced and locked in our skin. 
    <br>
    You will be able to notice whether a cleanser is too drying and harsh if after washing off, if it gives you a 
    <br>
    squeaky-clean tight feeling in your skin. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In the morning, you can skip cleansing altogether or use lukewarm water alone. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In the PM, if you are wearing makeup first use an oil-based cleanser. 
    <br>
    For your second cleanse, use a cleanser that is… 
    <br>
    <br>
    o   Gentle and non-foaming 
    <br>
    o   Milk, gel, or lotion cleanser 
    <br>
    o   pH balance closer to that of your skin’s natural pH (4.5 – 6.0) 
    </p> 
    <br>
    <h4>2. Use AHA with lower concentrations to exfoliate your skin</h4> 
    <p>
    Exfoliating is essential for any skin’s current state. 
    <br>
    Not exfoliating can lead to the accumulation of dead skin cells on the top of your skin, blocking your 
    <br>pores. This pore blockage would form a barrier preventing moisture from being absorbed so that any 
    <br>
    moisturising ingredients won’t be able to sink in, in turn making your skin dry. So, regular exfoliation 
    <br>
    will help hydrating products absorb into your skin better as well as hydrate new healthy skin cells.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>3. Oils </h4>
    <p>
    Oils fat in oleic acids can help trap moisture in your skin and protect it from external stressors, which 
    <br>overall helps keep your skin barrier healthily functioning. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are some oils rich in oleic acids that may help with your dryness: 
    <br>
    o	Marula 
    <br>
    o	Avocado 
    <br>
    o	Macadamia Nut 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>4. Beneficial Ingredients </h4>
    <p>
    Here are some ingredients to look for in products that will be helpful in nourishing your skin with hydration:
    <br>
    o  Glycerin
    <br> 
    o   Niacinamide 
    <br>
    o   Hyaluronic Acid  
    <br>
    o   Plant Oils 
    <br>
    o   Fatty Acids 
    <br>
    Urea
    <br>
    o   Aloe, oats, honey 
    <br>
    o   Butter
    <br>
    o   AHA
    <br>
    o   Sodium PCA
    <br>
    o   Lactic Acid 
    <br>
    o   Mandelic Acid 
    </p> 
    <br>
    <h4>5. Ingredients to avoid </h4>
    <p>
    Just as there are ingredients that can help keep your skin hydrated and draw hydration, there are also 
    <br>
    ingredients that can worsen dry skin. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Avoid: 
    <br>
    o   Benzoyl Peroxide 
    <br>
    o   Astringent 
    <br>
    o   Mineral Sunscreen 
    <br>
    o   Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)
    </p>
    <br> 
</div>
<br>
<div>     <!--DEHYDRATED-->
    <h3>Dehydrated Skin</h3>
    <h4>Fortunately, dehydrated skin is a temporary condition that can be fixed!</h4>
    <p>
    Having dehydrated skin means that your skin is currently lacking in enough water. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b> The possible causes of dehydrated skin are:</b>
    <br>
    o	Dry environments with little water in the atmosphere 
    <br>
    o	A high sodium diet 
    <br>
    o	Processed foods 
    <br>
    o	Not drinking enough water 
    <br>
    o	UV Rays 
    <br>
    o	A damaged skin barrier from over cleansing and over exfoliating 
    <br>
    o	Stress 
    <br>
    o	Medication
    </p>
    <h3>What should I do?</h3>
    <h4> 1.	Don’t take HOT showers</h4>
    <p>
    Hot showers promote trans epidermal water loss and can strip your skin of its natural oils and 
    <br>
    healthy fats, which are essential to a healthy skin barrier. 
    <br> 
    If you have any skin conditions  characterized by broken skin barriers, such as eczema, hot showers 
    <br>
    are definitely a NO as it will exacerbate your skin condition.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>2.	Like for dry skin, cleanse only when necessary and do so gently</h4>
    <p>
    Those with dehydrated skin can also experience dryness, therefore using a cleanser that is not drying 
    <br>
    and close to the pH of your skin is important so that you don’t worsen your skin’s lack of hydration. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4> 3.	Use products with ingredients that draw water to your skin and lock it in with a moisturiser!</h4>
    <p>
    Since your skin does not have enough hydration, you need to provide it with greater hydration and make sure
    <br>
     that it stays locked into your skin with a moisturiser.
    <br>
    <br>
    Humectants are water binders, meaning that they have the ability to draw the water molecules from their 
    <br>
    surroundings into the skin. Therefore, using products with humectants (including moisturisers) can help 
    <br>
    rehydrate your skin and increase it’s moisture levels. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are some common humectants:
    <br>
    o	Hyaluronic Acid 
    <br>
    o	Honey
    <br>
    o	Glycerine 
    <br>
    o	Panthenol B5 
    <br>
    o	AHA’s
    <br>
    <br>
    But be careful, if the humectant content in a product it too high and badly formulated it can have reversed 
    <br>
    effects by irritating and drawing moisture out from your skin.
    <br>
    <br>
    Although any good moisturiser will be effective in trapping the hydration into your skin, if you also have 
    <br>
    very dry skin, emollients and occlusive moisturisers may suit your skin better in  preventing moisture loss 
    <br>
    and trapping the water in your skin. However, if you are also acne prone, occlusive moisturisers may trigger acne.
    </p>
    <br>
   <h4>4.	Eat foods high in water content</h4>
    <p>
    Hydrating your skin can also come from within. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are a list of foods that can help put hydration back into your skin!
    <br>
    o	Cucumber 
    <br>
    o	Lettuce 
    <br>
    o	Tomatoes 
    <br>
    o   Spinach 
    <br>
    o	Strawberry 
    <br>
    o	Broccoli
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4> 5.	Consider buying a humidifier</h4>
    <p>
    If you are living in an environment where the air is dry with little moisture in the air, the water from your
    <br> 
    skin can be drawn out by the air, leaving your skin dehydrated. A humidifier actively counters this by emitting 
    <br>
    water into the air, increasing the moisture level in the air. This not only prevents the air from drawing out water 
    <br>
    from your skin, but also allows your skin to absorb more water.
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<div>     <!--OILY-->
    <h3>If your skin is feeling….</h3> 
    <h3><b>•	Oily</b></h3>
    <h4>You may currently be experiencing</h4>
    <p>
o	Excessive oil production 
    <br>
o	Enlarged pores 
    <br>    
o	A shiny complexion 
    <br>
o	Breakouts, blemishes, pimples
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>But why?</h4>
    <p>
    Our sebaceous glands naturally produce sebum to lubricate and moisturise our skin, which all in all helps have a 
    <br>
    strong skin barrier. However, if your skin barrier’s moisture and hydration levels are imbalanced, the sebaceous 
    <br>
    glands will respond by producing more sebum to try and protect your skin barrier. This makes our skin oiler and 
    <br>
    create feelings of discomfort from the grease. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This here demonstrates how different skin concerns can link and  share similar needs. If your skin is oily as a result 
    <br>
    of insufficient hydration and moisture, then you also need to focus your skincare on gaining more hydration and sealing it 
    <br>in. But because you are also experiencing more oiliness there are a few more things you need to implement in your skincare.
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3>What else should I do?</h3>
    <h4><b>
    1.	Include sebum-regulating ingredients in your products 
    </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
    Common ingredients that help regulate your sebum regulation:
    <br>
    o	Niacinamide – Boosts a natural moisturiser in your skin called ceramides. If niacinamide effectively helps in 
    <br>
    amplifying the ceramides in your skin, then the sebaceous glands won’t need to proactively produce lots of oil to 
    <br>
    compensate for dryness.
    <br>
    o	Zinc - sebum inhibitor. Zinc compounds like Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, and Zinc PCA can reduce the amount of sebum on the skin.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4><b>2.	Use oils fat in linoleic acid</b></h4>
    <p>
    Excessive sebum that is gloopy, hard, and greasy can also be due to a lack of linoleic acid in your skin. 
    <br>
    Applying oils high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid content will help rebalance your skin 
    <br>    
    by moisturising your skin and locking in the hydration you already have! It can also improve the consistency of 
    <br>
    your sebum into a healthier fluid. 
    <br>
    Sebum that is greasy is an unhealthy consistency as it is weaker in protecting your skin barrier, making your skin 
    <br>
    more prone to inflammations and higher sensitivity. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Popular Oils for Oily Skin:
    <br>
    o	Rosehip seed 
    <br>
    o	Hemp Seed 
    <br>
    o	Pumpkin Seed 
    <br>
    o	Grape Seed 
    <br>
    o	Jojoba
    </p>
    <h4><b>3.	Exfoliate skin using Salicylic Acid</b></h4>
    <h4><b>4.	Use non-comedogenic moisturisers</b></h4>
    <h4><b>5.	Take Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplements to reduce oil production</b></h4>
    <h4><b>6.	Avoid: Sugar, dairy as it can trigger inflammatory reactions.</b></h4>
    <br>
</div>
<br>
<div>   <!--SENSITIVE-->
    <h3>If your skin is feeling….</h3> 
    <h3><b>•	Sensitive </b></h3>
    <h4>You may be experiencing:</h4>
    <p>
    o	Redness
    <br>
    o	Burning
    <br>
    o	Severe dryness
    </p>
    <h4>But why?</h4>
    <p>Some possible causes:
    <br>
    o	Dry Skin
    <br>
    o	Allergic reaction to certain ingredients
    <br>
    o	Response to an ingredient that your skin is sensitive too
    <br>
    o	Abrasive Exfoliators which too high of a concentration
    </p>
    <h3>What should I do?</h3>
    <h4>1.	Learn WHAT your skin is sensitive to!</h4>
    <p>
    If you have started using a new product and your skin responds to it by being inflamed, itching, or burning, 
    <br>
    it’s probably not best for your skin. Some active ingredients such as Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinoids) are known 
    <br>
    to commonly cause a bit of irritation at the start. Therefore, if you are adding this active into your skincare 
    <br>
    routine, start at a very low concentration that your skin can handle, and protect it with sunscreen during the day.
    <br> 
    The same applies to using chemical exfoliators (AHA/BHA). Choose an exfoliator that is hydrating and gentle with 
    <br>
    a lower concentration that suits your skin. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are a few examples of common irritants, allergens, and sensitizing ingredients:
    <br>
    o	Oxybenzone 
    <br>
    o	Avobbenzone 
    <br>
    o	Octinoxate 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>2.	Avoid fragrance and essential oils</h4>
    <p>
    Artificial fragrance and essential oils are the most common skin sensitizers that can cause skin dermatitis, 
    <br>
    skin irritation and skin allergic reactions, especially if you have a broken skin barrier. Essential oils are 
    <br>
    aroma oils and are a volatile compound that can irritate your skin. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Some irritating essential oils are: 
    <br>
    o	Tea tree oil 
    <br>
    o	Lavender 
    <br>
    o	Cinnamon 
    <br>
    o	Clove 
    <br>
    o	Orange 
    <br>
    o	Peppermint
    <br>
    o	Ylang Ylang 
    <br>
    o	Citrus 
    <br>
    o	Lemon peel 
    <br>
    o	Geranium 
    <br>
    o	Bergamot 
    <br>
    <br>
    Essential oils that have been oxidised can be harmful to your skin as when essential oils are oxidised, it releases toxic compounds.
